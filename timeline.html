                  It was truly a wonderful experience to have Mr. Shrinivas Chamarthy at my residence.

                  During the visit to UN House in New Delhi, I had the pleasure of being accompanied by Mr. Jason, Sales Director of BROAD International. Together, we engaged in a fruitful discussion on District Energy Services (DES) for cooling with Mr. Ben, the Representative of UN Development Authority to India. The meeting focused on exploring collaborative efforts to promote energy-efficient cooling solutions and advance sustainable practices in the region, aligning with the UN's development objectives. The visit provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen partnerships between the private sector and international organizations to tackle environmental challenges and enhance energy sustainability.
