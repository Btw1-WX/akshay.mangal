                        Working with Broad group for nearly the past five years, I have inculcated in me an ability to

                        them. I actually test in the market and pitch according to varying needs of different customers.

                            I'm a staunch advocate for environmental preservation, and I actively incorporate this
                            commitment into my work. I explore and discuss the environmental impacts of HVAC and cooling
                            systems, and how we can lessen this impact. With a focus on sustainable alternatives and
                            breakthrough technologies, I aim to contribute towards reduced energy consumption and lower
                            carbon footprints. Let's work together to make our planet greener and more sustainable.
