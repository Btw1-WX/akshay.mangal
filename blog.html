                        When I first entered the HVAC industry as a fresh Civil Engineering graduate from National
                        Institute
                        of Technology, Surat, I knew I was stepping into an arena that was continually evolving and
                        innovating. What I didn't realize at the time was how my journey would intertwine with the
                        pivotal
                        mission of energy conservation, and how much I would learn and grow in the process.
