                        Vapor absorption machines (VAMs) are a shining example of environmentally friendly HVAC

                        and low environmental impact? Let's break down the complicated VAM mechanism.Conventional AC
                        units use electricity to power a compressor in a
                        vapor-compression cycle. Instead of using electricity as their major energy source, VAMs rely on
                        a vapor-absorption cycle.
