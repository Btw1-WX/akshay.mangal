                        When I first entered the HVAC industry as a fresh Civil Engineering graduate from National
                        Institute
                        of Technology, Surat, I knew I was stepping into an arena that was continually evolving and
                        innovating. What I didn't realize at the time was how my journey would intertwine with the
                        pivotal
                        mission of energy conservation, and how much I would learn and grow in the process.

                        nurturing
                        relationships with some of the most reputed clients from various industries. Along the way, I
                        have
                        come to appreciate and master the art of maintaining these relationships, blending technical

                        interplay between research and development (R&D) and manufacturing. It's in this intersection
                        that a
                        product moves from being a conceptual idea to a tangible asset that can meet the unique needs of
                        customers. Throughout my journey, understanding and bridging the gap between these two pillars
                        has
                        played a crucial role in fulfilling special customer requirements.</div>

                        conditioning (HVAC) systems. These innovative systems not only contribute to a greener planet
